##Liquibase SqlFire Plugin##
This adds support for the Pivotal's SqlFire database to Liquibase, version 3.1.1.

SqlFire is an in-memory distributed SQL database. In the category of NewSQL databases, SQLFire delivers dynamic scalability and high performance for data-intensive modern applications. 

SqlFire provides it's sql interface by using a port of Apache Derby.


###How to Use###

Intended for use with Liquibase version 3.1.1.

SqlFire reports its Database Product Name as "Apache Derby". The Priority for SqlFireDatabase has been set to **PRIORITY_DATABASE** and should be picked up before the DerbyDatabse implementation.


###Supported Refactoring/Changes###
With SqlFire there are two layers where a Liquibase refactor may not be supported. As SqlFire uses Apache Derby as it's sql interface a method may not supported at the Apache Derby. It is also possible that the underlying SqlFire Database may not support certain features.  

Generally the SqlFire features is a subset of those support by Apache Derby.
